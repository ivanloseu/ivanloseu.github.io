<b> Lectures by <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Okounkov">Andrei Okounkov</A> (Columbia), 

<p>Tuesday, March 17, 5-7pm, 105 Shillman, Thursday and Friday, March 19 and 20,
010 Behrakis, 4-6pm. Here is a <A HREF="http://www.northeastern.edu/campusmap/map/qad4.html">map</A>
(Shillman is building 30 and Behrakis is building 26).</b>
<p> <b>Topic</b>: <i>Computations in quantum K-theory</i>. 
This deals with ramifications of a nice short <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1287">paper</A> 
which offers a new approach to Geometric representation theory and computes quantum cohomology
of Nakajima quiver varieties.
<p><i>Background reading/watching</i>:
<p> 1) Equivariant K-theory, a reference is Chriss-Ginzburg book, Chapter 5. 
<p> 2) Some understanding of quantum cohomology will be useful. Possible source -- lectures of 
Barbara Bolognese, Michael Viscardi, Ryan Mickler, Eric Riedl from 
<A HREF="http://www.northeastern.edu/iloseu/qcoh.html">this seminar</A>. 
<p> 3) This is NOT a prerequisite but understanding connections between
quantum cohomology and representation theory may be useful as well.
Last year, Andrei gave a <A HREF="http://www.math.princeton.edu/events/seminars/3131/archive/2013-2014">
series of lectures</A> in Princeton on this topic, videos are available. There are also
notes of Mike McBreen's talks, see <A HREF="http://www.northeastern.edu/iloseu/McBreenTalk.pdf">here</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.northeastern.edu/iloseu/Mike_14.pdf">here</A>. 

<p> Lectures will be preceded by a graduate student <A HREF="quiver.html">seminar</A> 
in the first week of March.
