<p>Benjamin Schmidt, <i> Introduction to Derived Categories and Fourier Mukai Transforms</i>.
<p>Abstract: I will give a light introduction to the theory of bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves 
on smooth projective varieties. In particular, some of the issues arising from bad properties of the category 
of coherent sheaves will be pointed out. I will then talk about Fourier Mukai transforms in some more detail. 
One of the key results in this area due to Orlov says that every fully faithful functor between derived 
categories of coherent sheaves that admits right and left adjoints is a Fourier Mukai transform.

<p>Xiaolei Zhao,  <i>Spherical objects, braid group actions and the Mukai flop</i>, <A HREF="Xiaolei_lecture.pdf">Ivan's notes</A>.
<p>Abstract: We will first introduce the notion of spherical objects and see how they induce 
autoequivalences of derived categories. When we have a configuration of spherical objects, this gives 
rise to a braid group action on the category. For the second part, we will construct the Mukai flop, 
and show that derived categories of varieties connected by a Mukai flop are equivalent. These will be 
prerequisites for Joel's lectures, and we will follow the streamline in section 8.1, 8.2, 11.4 of 
Huybrechts' book.
