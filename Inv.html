<i>Content</i>: Here is a list of topics I hope to cover (in roughly this order, some of the topics will
occupy several lectures):
<br> 0) A brief intro to Invariant theory: origins and goals. 
<br> I) Invariant theory of finite groups: finiteness properties, Noether theorem 
(a bound on degrees of generators), Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem (on invariants of 
complex reflection groups). 
<br> II) Birational invariants: separation of generic orbits by birational invariants.
<br> III) Invariants under reductive group actions: a brief review of reductive groups,
Hilbert's theorems on quotients and quotient morphisms. Algebro-geometric properties
of quotients. 
<br> IV) Closed orbits in orbit closures: the Hilbert-Mumford theorem, Kempf's theorem of optimal 
destabilizing subgroups.  
<br> V) Connection to moment maps for compact group actions (the Kempf-Ness theorem)
and applications. 
<br> VI) Computation of invariants: Classical invariant theory.
<br> VII) Invariants under more general algebraic group actions, U-invariants. 
<br> VIII) GIT quotients: construction and properties. Linearization of line bundles. 
Applications to moduli spaces in  Algebraic geometry.
<br> IX) Local structure of the actions (Luna's etale slice theorem and applications).

<i>Prerequisites</i>: A basic knowledge of algebraic geometry (algebraic varieties, including affine and projective ones, morphisms and their special 
classes: affine, finite, projective, etc., properties of algebraic varieties such as smoothness, normality etc.) and the related
commutative algebra. Complex semisimple Lie groups,
Lie algebras and their finite dimensional representations.
