homeworks, etc. Please read it! 

</p><p><b>Goals</b>: This course serves an introduction to Commutative algebra with a discussion of category theory
and a brief discussion of connections to Algebraic geometry.  This 
<a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/MATH380_F2021_info.pdf">document</a> also contains a list of 
references. There is no required textbook.</p>

are also required to write your solution on your own, if it (partially) comes from a discussion. 
Homework sets and the take-home final should be submitted via Canvas. You are encouraged to texify your work, but 
scans of handwriting  are also acceptable. Overdue submissions will not be accepted.</p>
