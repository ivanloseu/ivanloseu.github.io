homeworks, etc. Please read it! 

</p><p><b>Goals</b>: This course serves as an introduction to Commutative algebra with a discussion of category theory
and a brief discussion of connections to Algebraic geometry and Number theory.  This 
<a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/MATH380_F2023_info.pdf">document</a> also contains a list of 
references. There is no required textbook.</p>

<p><b>Grading: </b>Based on 6 homework sets (60%) and a take-home final exam (40%).
Due dates for homeworks are TBA.</p>



<p><b>Rules: </b>For homework sets, peer discussion is allowed but only after your own thinking; you 
are also required to write your solution on your own, if it (partially) comes from a discussion. 
Homework sets and the take-home final should be submitted via Canvas. You are encouraged to texify your work, but 
scans of handwriting  are also acceptable. Overdue submissions will not be accepted.</p>

<p><b>Preliminary list of topics</b> together with their descriptions is in this 
<a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/MATH380_F2023_info.pdf">document</a> as well. 
You can also find <b>references</b> there.</p>

<p><b>Schedule</b>: <i>The first chapter in this class is Basics of Commutative algebra</i>. 
<LI> Aug 31, Lecture 1: <i>Rings, ideals and modules, part I</i>, <A HREF="380F23_lec1.pdf">notes</A>: 
The goal of this part is to introduce key concepts of this class. 
We will also be mentioning what's going to be studied later in the class. In this particular lecture, we introduce rings together with easy examples and constructions, ring homomorphisms, ideals and, time permitting, quotient rings.

The main part is a discussion about maximal ideals. We state Nullstellensatz and have a brief discussion of the relevance of ideals in Algebraic geometry.
