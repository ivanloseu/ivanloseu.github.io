The first lecture series in the Spring is by <A HREF="https://sites.google.com/view/gurbir-dhillon/home">Gurbir Dhillon</A>
and the topic is <i>An informal introduction to categorical actions of groups</i>. The first lecture is on Feb 3. 
For a prospective schedule, notes and videos, visit <A HREF="https://sites.google.com/view/gurbir-dhillon/an-informal-introduction-to-categorical-representation-theory">here</A>.

<p><b>Abstract</b>: The theory of categorical actions of groups is an important actor in modern representation theory. It has undergone rapid development in the past twenty years, principally due to its applications in the geometric Langlands program, with decisive contributions by Beilinson, Drinfeld, Frenkel, and Gaitsgory, and more recently Beraldo, Raskin, and Yang. Our goal will be to give a motivated introduction to this circle of ideas.

<p> Categorical actions are deeply intertwined with the representation theory of Lie algebras in their history and major applications, and we will emphasize these connections throughout. In particular, using ideas from categorical representation theory, we will give a very simple proof of Beilinson--Bernstein localization for semisimple Lie algebras. Moreover, using ideas from local geometric Langlands, we will meet a version of Beilinson--Bernstein localization for affine Lie algebras at critical level, as developed by the above authors. 

<p> Prerequisites and Material: It will be helpful to have some familiarity with semisimple Lie algebras and their representation theory, algebraic geomety, and homological algebra, but not much beyond a first course in any of these topics. We will largely follow a
