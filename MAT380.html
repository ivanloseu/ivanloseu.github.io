<p><b>Lectures: </b>TTh 13:00-14:15, LOM 205. The first day of class is <b>8/29</b>, and the last day of class is <b>12/5</b>.</p>

<p><b>Office hours: </b>T 2.30-3.30pm, Th 10.30-11.30 in DL 416.</p>

<p><b>Goals</b>: This course serves an introduction to Commutative and Homological algebra.  
We will be mostly following [AM] and [HS]. Additional references include [AK] and [E].  There is no required text book.</p>

<p><b>Grading: </b>Based on 6 homework sets (60%) and a take-home final exam (40%).</p>

<p><b>Rules: </b>For homework sets, peer discussion is allowed but only after your own thinking; you 
are also required to write your solution on your own, if it (partially) comes from a discussion. 
Homework sets and the take-home final should be submitted in PDF form, with the file name 
<b>380HWn_[your last name].pdf</b> to the instructor by email with the title line 
<b>380HWn</b> (n=1,2,3,4,5,6). You are encouraged to texify your work, but 
scans of handwriting  are also acceptable. Overdue submissions will not be accepted.</p>

<p><b>Final: </b>The final exam will be take-home. It will be posted here on the evening of <b>Dec 5</b>, 
and will be due by the end of <b>Dec 11</b>. For the final, you are not allowed to discuss with anyone 
else; and you are not allowed to consult any external resources except your own notes and 
homework sets for this course.</p>
