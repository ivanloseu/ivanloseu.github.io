 Lectures by <A HREF="https://www.math.lsu.edu/~pramod/">Pramod Achar</A> (LSU),
<p>This is a six hour lecture course to be given at Northeastern in the week of February 20-24.
<p> Tuesday, Feb 21, 10am-12pm,  Thursday, Feb 23, 2-4pm, Friday, Feb 24, 10am-12pm. All three lectures 
are in WVF 010 (WVF is building 23F on <A HREF="http://www.northeastern.edu/campusmap/map/qad4.html">this map</A>) 
<p><b>Title</b>: Introduction to affine Grassmannians and the geometric Satake equivalence.
<p><b>Abstract</b>: 
The goal of these lectures will be to start from scratch and learn what the affine Grassmannian of a reductive group is, 
and how its geometry is related to the representation theory of reductive groups. I will emphasize the examples of GL_n and SL_2 throughout.

<p>Here is a rough outline of the three lectures:<br>
Lecture 1: definitions; lattice model for GL_n; orbits.<br>
Lecture 2: convolution product; Lusztig's q-analogue of the weight multiplicity; geometric Satake equivalence.<br>
Lecture 3: Iwahori orbits; Finkelberg-Mirkovic conjecture; Koszul duality.<br>
