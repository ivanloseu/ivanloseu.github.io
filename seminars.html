<p> I  have a habit of coorganizing graduate student topics seminars on various subjects related to Representation theory 
(notes available!):
<p> In Fall 2023 I ran (with help from Gurbir Dhillon and Sam Raskin) the graduate learning seminar on D-modules.
The webpage is <A HREF="D-modules.html">here</A>. 
<p>  In Spring 2021, I coorganized a learning <A HREF="quantum_seminar.html">seminar</A> on quantum groups.
This was a part of activities of the IAS <A HREF="https://www.ias.edu/math/sp/geometric_modular_reptheory">
special year</A> on Geometric and Modular representation theory.
<p> In Fall 2020, I coorganized a learning <A HREF="Hitchin.html">seminar</A> on Hitchin moduli spaces. 
<p> In Fall 2018, I've coorganized  a graduate student seminar on perverse sheaves.
See <A HREF="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~jkamnitz/seminar/perverse/perverse.html">here</A> for details. 
<p>In Fall 2017, I've coorganized a graduate student seminar on Category O and Soergel bimodules. See <A HREF="O.html">here</A>
for details. 
<p> In the Spring 2017 I've coorganized <A HREF="DAHAEHA.html">DAHAEHA</A> (Double Affine Hecke Algebras
and Elliptic Hall Algebras) seminar. 
<p> In the Spring 2016 I've coorganized  MIT-NEU graduate student seminar on moduli spaces
of sheaves on K3 surfaces. Here are the <A HREF="MSK3.html">details</A>. 
<p> In the <A HREF="quiver.html">Spring 2015</A>, we were discussing various things related to quiver varities.

This was accompanied by several invited lectures by <A HREF="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~rouquier/">Raphael Rouquier</A> (UCLA),
<A HREF="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~okounkov/">Andrei Okounkov</A>
(Columbia) and <A HREF="http://www.mi.ras.ru/~kaledin/">Dmitry Kaledin</A>
(Steklov Institute).      
<p> In the <A HREF="AHAHA.html">Fall 2014</A>,  we were focussing  on Hecke algebras.

<p> 

In 
the <A HREF="qcoh1.html">Spring 2014</A>, we discussed various geometric and representation theoretic  questions related to the Hilbert scheme
of points on the plane. 
<p>

 In the <A HREF="qcoh.html">Fall 2013</A> we did our best to study connections between quantum cohomology and representation theory
in the setting of cotangent bundles to flag varieties.
