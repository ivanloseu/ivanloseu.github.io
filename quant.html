<body> <h2 align="center">  <b> Quantizations and representations.</b> </h2>

<p> This is a crash course on basics of (deformation) quantizations and their modules. About five 1-hour lectures.


<p><b>Schedule</b>: 
<LI> <b>Aug 28, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b>, Lecture 1, <A HREF="quant1.pdf">notes</A>: I will discuss basics of filtered quantizations and introduce important examples: universal enveloping algebras and algebras of differential operators on smooth affine varieties. If time permits, I'll discuss 
a connection with formal quantizations. 
<LI> <b>Sept 2, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b>, Lecture 2, <A HREF="quant2.pdf">notes</A>: I will discuss formal quantizations and their relation to the filtered ones and then the localization procedure for quantizations (sometimes called the microlocalization). 
<LI> <b>Sept 4, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b>, Lecture 3, <A HREF="quant3.pdf">notes</A>: I will discuss completions of quantizations, the quantum slice theorem and an application to constructing finite W-algebras. 
<LI> <b> Sept 16, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b> (note that there's no lectures in week of Sept 8-12), <A HREF="quant4.pdf">notes</A>: I will start discussion of classification of quantizations concentrating on the symplectic case. 
<LI> <b> Sept 18, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b>,  <A HREF="quant5.pdf">notes</A>: I will define conical symplectic singularities and give some examples. Then I'll discuss their quantizations.
<LI> <b> Sept 23, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b>, <A HREF="quant6.pdf">notes</A>: I will talk about modules over quantizations, their good filtrations and associated varieties. We'll also discuss holonomic modules and distinguished good filtrations. 
<LI> <b> Sept 25, 10.25-11.25 in KT 801</b>, <A HREF="quant7.pdf">notes</A>: I will talk about the restriction functor for Harish-Chandra modules.
<LI> THE END!
