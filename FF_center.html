<title> Seminar: representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras at the critical level. </title></head>

<body> <h2  align=center>  <b>Seminar: representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras at the critical level.</b></h2>

<p>Time: generally 4-6.15pm, Thursdays, at MIT, <b>room 26-168</b>. If there's a related Math activity scheduled at MIT at 4 (such as colloquium) or elsewhere, the seminar may move to 5.45-8pm. 

<p> Organized by <A HREF="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=22">Roman Bezrukavnikov</A>, 
<A HREF="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=66">Pavel Etingof</A>,
<A HREF="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/">Ivan Losev</A>, <A HREF="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2525">Leonid Rybnikov</A>, <A HREF="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2432">David Yang</A>, and <A HREF="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1201">Zhiwei Yun</A>.

<p>This is a graduate learning seminar, where students give lecture advised by one of the seminar organizers, most likely Prof. Losev. Please contact Prof. Losev if you'd like to give a talk.  

<p>This seminar is a successor of the series of seminars organized by some organizers in 2013-2017. In particular, these 
seminars played an important role in Prof. Etingof's professional growth:
he progressed from <A HREF="Pasha_bad.jpg">this</A> to <A HREF="Pasha_good.png">this</A> and finally, even to <A HREF="Pasha_supreme_leader.jpg">this</A>. 
Unfortunately, the pause in the seminar series brought him to <A HREF="Pasha_down.jpg">this state</A>... Let's help Prof. Etingof to get back to his former shape! 

<p> This year seminar is going to concetrate on Edward Frenkel's <A HREF="https://math.berkeley.edu/~frenkel/loop.pdf">book</A> on the Langlands correspondence for 
loop groups. The preliminary plan is to go over chapters 2-8, including free field realizations, Wakimoto modules, and the center at the critical level 
(with more time permitting).  

<p> Prerequisites include basic knowledge of the BGG category O (Etingof's course from Fall 2023 or the first three lectures <A HREF="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/O.html">here</A> should do) and basics on (affine) Kac-Moody algebras and their integrable representations (Chapters 1-7 and 9 from the Kac Infinite dimensional Lie algebras book should do, and so should the class taught by Rybnikov in Fall 2023).
