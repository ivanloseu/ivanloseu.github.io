  <body>This is a webpage for the pre-seminar to the seminar by
Daniel Juteau, Carl Mautner, Simon Riche and Geordie Williamson
somewhere in Russia in July 2019. Ask Valera L. for details. 
The pre-seminar lectures will be given  by myself and Vasya Krylov. 
It's conceivable that this page (or its successor at Yale) is going to be occasionally updated with various materials. 

<p> Less preliminary <A HREF="dacha_preseminar.pdf">program</A>. 

<p> Prerequisites: 

<p>a) Algebraic geometry: Chapters 2 and 3 of Hartshonre should be sufficient. 

<p>b) Homological algebra: we are going to assume a reasonable knowledge
of derived and triangulated category. Chapter 1 of Kashiwara-Shapira
should be sufficient.

<p>c) Lie algebras and algebraic groups. This is going to be reminded 
but a prior familiarity with the basics of the subject will be
very useful.
