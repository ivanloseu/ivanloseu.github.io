<body> <h2 align="center">  <b> MATH720 (Spring 2022): Topics in Representation theory.</b> </h2>

<p><b>Instructor: </b>Prof. Ivan Loseu (email: ivan.loseu@yale.edu)</p>

<p><b>Lectures: </b>MW 11.35-12.50pm, Location: DL 431. 
The first class is on <b>8/31</b>, and the last  class is on <b>12/7</b> (note that the 2nd class is on Friday, Sept 2).</p>

<p><b>Office hours: </b> TBA, DL 416. </p>

<p> The class discusses the geometry and representation theory associated to singular symplectic varieties as well as applications to
Lie representation theory. Here is a <b>preliminary program</b>:</p>

<p>0) Motivation: unitary representations of Lie groups and Orbit method. Quantum and classical mechanics.
Express introduction to Poisson and Symplectic geometry.

<p>1) Orbits in semisimple Lie algebras. Their classification. sl_2-triples. Fundamental groups and equivariant covers.  

<p>2) Singular symplectic varieties and symplectic resolutions. Motivations and key examples. Q-factorial terminalizations.
Lusztig-Spaltenstein induction. Construction of Q-factorial terminalizations for affinizations of nilpotent orbits and their covers
via Hamiltonian reduction. Deformations. 

<p>3) Quantizations. Motivations from Representation theory. Classification of quantizations. Quantum Hamiltonian reduction. 
Quantizations of affinizations of covers of nilpotent orbits. 

<p>4) Harish-Chandra modules and bimodules for semisimple Lie algebras. Harish-Chandra bimodules over quantizations. 
Classification of Harish-Chandra bimodules with full support. Time permitting, we'll also discuss Harish-Chandra modules.
