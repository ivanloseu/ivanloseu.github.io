<p> <A HREF="http://www.msri.org/people/18666">Talks</A> I gave at MSRI
(on W-algebras in 2008 and on Procesi bundles in 2013).  


<p> Three introductory lectures on W-algebras I gave at the Issac Newton 
Institute in 2009 are available

<p> Here are <A HREF="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/person.phtml?option_lang=rus&personid=20427">videos</A>
of 
lectures for students that I gave at the summer school "Modern mathematics" in 2012 (in Russian). 


<p> This <A HREF="http://ium.mccme.ru/IUM-video.html#Globus">page</A> contains a video recording
of my talk at the IUM Globus seminar in May 2013. 
The talk is on a connection of everything to 
everything else (in Russian).
