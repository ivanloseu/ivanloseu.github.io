<b>MATH 7313, Representation theory: modern introduction (Fall 2015)</b>


<hr>

Unofficial <A HREF="rep_syll.pdf">syllabus</A>. An official one can be found on
Blackboard. 

<hr>
Sept 9, Lecture 0, <A HREF="RT/RT0.pdf">notes</A>: I  recall a bunch of basic facts about the representation theory
of associative algebras and finite groups that often appear in graduate algebra classes. 
<hr>
Sept 14, Lecture 1 <A HREF="RT/RT1.pdf">notes</A>: I start to explain an approach of Okounkov and Vershik to the representation
theory of symmetric groups. The approach is inductive in nature: what one needs to understand is
how irreducible representations of S_n restrict to S_m\subset S_n.  
<hr>
Sept 16, Lecture 2 <A HREF="RT/RT2.pdf">notes</A>: I continue (and hopefully finish) the discussion of the representation theory of the symmetric 
groups. In particular, we are going to see how degenerate affine Hecke algebras naturally appear in this theory. 
<hr>
<A HREF="RT/RT_prob1.pdf">Problem Set 1</A>, due Sept 30, 
<A HREF="RT/RT_hints1.pdf">Hints</A>. 
<hr>
Sept 21, Lecture 3 <A HREF="RT/RT3.pdf">notes</A>: I start to discuss algebraic groups and their Lie algebras. Then I study the representation
theory of sl_2(C). I assume that the audience knows basic definitions related to Lie algebras.
<hr>
<FONT color=#FF0000>Class moves: 4.30-6pm, 544NI</FONT>
<hr>
Sept 23, Lecture 4 <A HREF="RT/RT4.pdf">notes</A>: I discuss the representations of sl_2(F) and SL_2(F), where F is an algebraically closed
field of positive characteristic. 
<hr>
Sept 28, Lecture 5 <A HREF="RT/RT5.pdf">notes</A>, <A HREF="RT/Dynkin.pdf">picture</A>: 
I explain the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras in characteristic 0. 
<hr>
Sept 30, Lecture 6 <A HREF="RT/RT6.pdf">notes</A>: I introduce Kac-Moody algebras. Then I discuss the finite dimensional representation theory
of semisimple Lie algebras in characteristic 0. And, finally, I discuss the structure and representation
theory of reductive algebraic groups in characteristic 0.
<hr>
<A HREF="RT/RT_prob2.pdf">Problem Set 2</A>, due Oct 19, 
<A HREF="RT/RT_hints2.pdf">Hints</A>.
<hr>
Oct 5, Lecture 7 <A HREF="RT/RT7.pdf">notes</A>: we discuss the category O for a semisimple Lie algebra in characteristic 0. Then we switch to representations
of reductive algebraic groups, both in 0 and positive characteristic. 
<hr>
Oct 7, Lecture 8 <A HREF="RT/RT8.pdf">notes</A>: we discuss the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras in positive characteristic. Then we start a new topic:
we study the complex representations of GL_n(F_q).
<hr>
Oct 14, Lecture 9 <A HREF="RT/RT9.pdf">notes</A> (include Deligne-Lusztig induction, not to be covered
in class): we discuss the Hecke algebras for general Weyl groups and the structure and representation
theory of general finite groups of Lie type, hopefully, including the Deligne-Lusztig induction. 
<hr>
Oct 19, Lecture 10 <A HREF="RT/RT10.pdf">notes</A>: I define Kazhdan-Lusztig bases in Hecke algebras and explain its connection to multiplicities
in categories O.
<hr>
Oct 21, Lecture 11 <A HREF="RT/RT11.pdf">notes</A>: I continue to study the category O and introduce Soergel (bi)modules. 
<hr>
<A HREF="RT/RT_prob3.pdf">Problem Set 3</A>, due Nov 4, 
<A HREF="RT/RT_hints3.pdf">Hints</A>. 
<hr>
Oct 26, Lecture 12 <A HREF="RT/RT12.pdf">notes</A>: I talk about Hopf algebras and define the quantum group U_q(sl_2). 
<hr>
Oct 28, Lecture 13 <A HREF="RT/RT13.pdf">notes</A>: I will discuss the representation theory of U_q(sl_2) when q is not a root of 1 and also 
the universal R-matrix.  
<hr>
Nov 2, Lecture 14 <A HREF="RT/RT14.pdf">notes</A>, <A HREF="RT/RT14_Pic1.pdf">picture 1</A>,
<A HREF="RT/RT14_Pic2.pdf">picture 2</A>,  <A HREF="RT/RT14_Pic3.pdf">picture 3</A>
: I explain how to get  link invariants from representations of quantum groups. 
<hr>
Nov 4, Lecture 15 <A HREF="RT/RT15.pdf">notes</A> (with corrected formulas!): I discuss the quantum groups at roots of 1.
<hr>
<A HREF="RT/RT_prob4.pdf">Problem Set 4</A>, due Nov 25, 
<A HREF="RT/RT_hints4.pdf">Hints</A>. 
<hr>
<FONT color=#FF0000>Class on Monday, Nov 9 is cancelled, and Nov 11 is a holiday</FONT>
<hr>
Nov 16, Lecture 16 <A HREF="RT/RT16.pdf">notes</A>, <A HREF=RT/quiver_pic.pdf>picture</A>: I will discuss the Kac theorem on the indecomposable representations of quivers. 
I will also start deformed preprojective algebras.  
<hr>
Nov 18, Lecture 17 <A HREF="RT/RT17.pdf">notes</A>: I will discuss the representations of deformed preprojective algebras and their application to Kac's theorem. 
<hr>
Nov 23, Lecture 18 <A HREF="RT/RT18.pdf">notes</A>: I will talk about an application of the deformed preprojective algebras to 
the additive Deligne-Simpson problem.

algebras and Kleinian singularities.

<hr>
Nov 30, Lecture 19 <A HREF="RT/RT19.pdf">notes</A>: I start discussing actions of Kac-Moody algebras on categories and the representation theory of the symmetric
groups in positive characteristic.
