<LI> On this page you'll find various information regarding Yale's graduate visiting day. The default arrival and departure dates are March 2 (Sunday) and March 4 (Tuesday), respectively. New Haven is a great city and the Yale campus is gorgeous, so you may want to arrive earlier on Sunday and/or depart later on Tuesday. Also, if you depart later on Tuesday there will be more opportunities to interact with faculty and current graduate students.
